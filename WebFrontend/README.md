# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Environment configuration

The frontend reads the backend base URL from a Vite environment variable:

- `VITE_API_BASE` — Required. Example: `https://api.cloudunify.pro/api/v1`

Configure it via your environment or a `.env` file at the project root during development (never commit secrets).

## Bulk upload (Resources & Costs)

The Resources and Costs pages include a bulk uploader that accepts `.csv` or `.xlsx` files:

- Files are parsed client-side using the mapping utilities (CSV/XLSX)
- Headers are normalized and data coerced (dates, numbers, enums)
- Client-side validation highlights row-level issues before upload
- Valid rows are POSTed to the backend (`/resources/bulk` or `/costs/bulk`)
- The Authorization header is automatically attached via the configured HTTP client
- The server response shows counts for inserted/updated/invalid and any row-level errors

For uploads, provide:
- Organization ID (required)
- Cloud Account ID (optional)

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
